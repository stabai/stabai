### Hi! 👋

I'm Shawn Tabai, and I'm a software engineer. I love solving problems and enjoy working on scalable infrastructure. I also love to laugh at the absurdity of the world.

I'm a parent, a promoter of mental health, an opponent of the patriarchy, and an advocate for social equity. I believe the field of computer science desperately needs to increase its outreach to underrepresented groups, and I want to contribute to that in any way I can.

In addition to programming, I'm a big fan of:
* 📝 Writing
* 📚 Reading
* 🎤 Karaoke
* 🤯 Philosophy
* 🐉 D&D
* 👍 Mentoring
* 👾 Retro games
* 📕 Lord of the Rings
* 🦉 The Owl House
